## 2. Security Assessment (CA)

### CA.L2-3.12.1 – Periodically assess security controls

Mapped Artifact:
- 04-GDPR-Compliance-Checklist.md

How This Demonstrates Compliance:
- Structured evaluation of implemented safeguards
- Accountability documentation
- Evidence-based control verification

---

## 3. System and Information Integrity (SI)

### SI.L2-3.14.1 – Identify and manage system flaws

## Governance Perspective

While these labs are GDPR-focused, the documentation structure mirrors CMMC expectations:

- Defined scope
- Identified risks
- Control mapping
- Mitigation tracking
- Accountability documentation

This exercise demonstrates how governance artifacts can be translated across compliance frameworks.
