# Lab 02 – ROPA and Governance Scenario (Work in Progress)

This lab will build on the DPIA work from Lab 01 and focus on operationalizing GDPR governance through:

- Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)
- Breach notification timelines and decision-making
- Cross-border data transfer risk assessment

---

## Planned Focus

### 1. ROPA Entries  
Define a small set of core processing activities for a fictional organization and create structured ROPA entries for each.

### 2. Breach Notification Scenario  
Walk through a simulated security incident to determine:

- Whether it is notifiable under GDPR  
- Who must be notified  
- The timing and key information elements  
- What should be documented in the incident log  

### 3. Cross-Border Data Transfers  
Identify any transfers outside the EU/EEA, evaluate the safeguards, and document potential risks or required mitigations.

## Purpose

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how different governance artifacts connect:

- DPIA findings  
- Day-to-day processing records  
- Incident response decisions  
- Regulatory documentation  

This README is a placeholder and will be expanded as the lab is developed.
